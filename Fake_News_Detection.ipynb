The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Police fired tear gas on Thursday at the protesting students. Video footage posted on social media later in the day showed uniformed officers outside dormitories and inside classrooms using batons to hit people who did not appear to be involved in the campus protests.  It was the latest crackdown by police on protests since an Aug. 8 presidential election that was later annulled by the Supreme Court. A re-run of the vote has been set for Oct. 26. The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)  this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,  the authority said on its Twitter feed.  It requested that any member of the public come forward to provide information to aid the investigation.  The students had been protesting against the re-arrest of a lawmaker, Paul Ongili Owino, on Wednesday, shortly after he was released on bail on charges of subversion for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a  son of a dog  at a campaign rally. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often roiled by violence. Preparations for the re-run of the election are being closely monitored for signs of instability, after at least 28 people were killed in unrest following the Aug. 8 vote. The IPOA watchdog was created in 2011, after police came under severe criticism for the number of protesters killed during demonstrations against disputed elections in 2007. The violence then killed around 1,2000 people. But local and international rights groups say the institution is struggling to fulfill its mandate to investigate allegations of police brutality in a country rife with reports from civilians of extrajudicial killings by security forces.  The IPOA has secured two convictions of police officers in the four years it has been operational. The watchdog pledged last month to fast-track investigations into high-profile deaths such as that of a baby allegedly killed by police in the violence after the election. [L4N1L34FC] But people familiar with the status of these investigations say the police are not cooperating with them, and that senior officials in the police force and the interior ministry insist officers killed only thieves and thugs. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don\\u2019t want them here,\\u201d Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \\u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\\u201d he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. \\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\\u201d said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with \\u201cgreen cards\\u201d allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \\u201cIt\\u2019s chaos,\\u201d Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syria\\u2019s civil war, saying refugees could be a \\u201cTrojan horse\\u201d that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for \\u201cextreme vetting.\\u201d  Trump\\u2019s order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. \\u201cIf they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\\u201d said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\\u201d Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \\u201cThose two 18-year-old daughters won\\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\\u201d she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trump\\u2019s order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. \\u201cToday\\u2019s executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. \\u201cI am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. \\u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,\\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trump\\u2019s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran\\u2019s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trump\\u2019s new restrictions on immigration. \\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. \\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\\u201d said  Gabriel. \\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\\u201d \",\n          \"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11.      Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament.  President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar.  Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan.  It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government.  The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Police fired tear gas on Thursday at the protesting students. Video footage posted on social media later in the day showed uniformed officers outside dormitories and inside classrooms using batons to hit people who did not appear to be involved in the campus protests.  It was the latest crackdown by police on protests since an Aug. 8 presidential election that was later annulled by the Supreme Court. A re-run of the vote has been set for Oct. 26. The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)  this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,  the authority said on its Twitter feed.  It requested that any member of the public come forward to provide information to aid the investigation.  The students had been protesting against the re-arrest of a lawmaker, Paul Ongili Owino, on Wednesday, shortly after he was released on bail on charges of subversion for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a  son of a dog  at a campaign rally. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often roiled by violence. Preparations for the re-run of the election are being closely monitored for signs of instability, after at least 28 people were killed in unrest following the Aug. 8 vote. The IPOA watchdog was created in 2011, after police came under severe criticism for the number of protesters killed during demonstrations against disputed elections in 2007. The violence then killed around 1,2000 people. But local and international rights groups say the institution is struggling to fulfill its mandate to investigate allegations of police brutality in a country rife with reports from civilians of extrajudicial killings by security forces.  The IPOA has secured two convictions of police officers in the four years it has been operational. The watchdog pledged last month to fast-track investigations into high-profile deaths such as that of a baby allegedly killed by police in the violence after the election. [L4N1L34FC] But people familiar with the status of these investigations say the police are not cooperating with them, and that senior officials in the police force and the interior ministry insist officers killed only thieves and thugs. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don\\u2019t want them here,\\u201d Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \\u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\\u201d he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. \\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\\u201d said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with \\u201cgreen cards\\u201d allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \\u201cIt\\u2019s chaos,\\u201d Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syria\\u2019s civil war, saying refugees could be a \\u201cTrojan horse\\u201d that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for \\u201cextreme vetting.\\u201d  Trump\\u2019s order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. \\u201cIf they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\\u201d said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\\u201d Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \\u201cThose two 18-year-old daughters won\\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\\u201d she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trump\\u2019s order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. \\u201cToday\\u2019s executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. \\u201cI am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. \\u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,\\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trump\\u2019s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran\\u2019s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trump\\u2019s new restrictions on immigration. \\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. \\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\\u201d said  Gabriel. \\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\\u201d \",\n          \"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11.      Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament.  President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar.  Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan.  It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government.  The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.  RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying:  Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.  The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships. According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further.  The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal. \",\n          \"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr\",\n          \"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.  RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying:  Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.  The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships. According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further.  The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal. \",\n          \"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr\",\n          \"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.  RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying:  Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.  The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships. According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further.  The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal. \",\n          \"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr\",\n          \"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.  RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying:  Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.  The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships. According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further.  The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal. \",\n          \"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr\",\n          \"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The deal, signed on Jan. 18 will expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.  RIA news agency separately quoted Sergei Shoigu as saying:  Last week the Commander-in-Chief (President Vladimir Putin) approved the structure and the bases in Tartus and in Hmeimim (air base). We have begun forming a permanent presence there.  The Tartus naval facility, in use since the says of the Soviet Union, is too small to play host to larger warships. According to the RIA report, the agreement will allow Russia to keep 11 warships at Tartus, including nuclear vessels. The agreement will last for 49 years and could be prolonged further.  The Hmeimim air base, from which Russia has launched numerous air strikes in support of President Bashar al-Assad during his war with rebels, can now be used by Russia indefinitely, according to the deal. \",\n          \"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr\",\n          \"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
